Assignment and Increment operators

Assignment operators

int x = 10 (Sets x equal to 10)

x += 10 (Says x + 10, or 10 plus 10)
x-=10 (Says x - 10, or 10 minus 10)
x *= 10 (Says x * 10 or 10 times 10)
x /= 10 (Says x / 10 or x divided by 10)
x %= 3 (Takes 10 and divides by 3 and only output the remainder which is 1)

Increment operators

x++ (Says x + 1 or 10 plus 1)
++x (Says 1 + x or 1 plus 10)
x-- (Says x - 1 or 10 - 1)
--x (Says 1 - x or 1 - 10)
